Class Participation
-------------------

_15.281 Advanced Communication for Leaders_ is designed to be a highly interactive class. The ability to contribute to an open discussion of ideas and to defend your position on a subject is an important leadership skill that you can work in this class. You can excel in class participation if you are on time, stay to the end, and contribute in these ways:

*   Provide strong evidence of having prepared and thought through the material.
*   Advance the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.
*   Share constructive feedback with your peers when appropriate.
*   Listen attentively in class.
*   Demonstrate interest in your peers' comments, questions, and / or presentations.

Attendance is critical to learning in 15.281 and as such unexcused absences result in a "zero" participation grade for the missed sessions. Late assignments will be penalized.

Procedures for Writing Assignments
----------------------------------

*   Use standard U.S. business formats (including single spacing within paragraphs).
*   Print out final versions for submission.

Procedures for Oral Presentations
---------------------------------

Some of your oral presentations will take place outside class time in an extra session with other students and your professor or TA—slots are available on different days and times to accommodate schedules.

If you miss a scheduled oral presentation without advance consultation, you will receive a score of zero for that assignment.
